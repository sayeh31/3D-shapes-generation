oval shaped top with metal structure table
A very vintage looking end table. Its fairly tall and has a unique design to it.
round white table with four curved legs
A small grey oval surface with a groove for pencils. It has a round body and decorative legs in an early century design.
This table appears to be artistic in shape in that the legs are bowed instead of straight and looks to be made of a plastic or acrylic material the way light shines off it.
