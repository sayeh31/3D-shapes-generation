a simple but elegant looking green chair is perfect for my room
a green chair with a tall back and cylinder armrests with a brown lever on the side of the chair.
It is a chair which is entirely made of cushion. It is green in colour and is very solid and sturdy and is reclinable.
A high backed sofa chair in moss green. The sides and the seat all are attached up to the floor and there is some wooden detail on the left side.
a green lazyboy chair.  There is a handle on the left side to allow for the foot rest to be pulled up.
