SINGLE LEG ROUND BASE TABLE MADE OF GLASS LOOKS STYLISH
A modern black table with a circular glass top and base made out of spheres
a round table with dark glass on top and a base or leg made out of black spheres placed on top of each other in the form of a pyramid, but standing on the pyramid's top (i.e. one sphere on the bottom, then three on top of it and six on top of them, on top of which comes the round dark glass top)
