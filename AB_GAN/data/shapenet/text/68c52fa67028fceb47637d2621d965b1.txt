This is a trendy glass table.
It is a coffee table with a translucent gray glass top. The table itself is constructed of gray metal, with two extra horizontal beams on one side.
I see a blue box with two sentences written in black type. Beneath the blue box with the sentences there is a gray box with the word Next in it.
