a black and red and gray wooden step legs chair
it's a cussain chair color black and diagonal shape
This is a complex chair, that is grey, red, and black.  The sides of the back stick out further than the top of the back, and it has pieces that stick out in the front on each side. Reminds me of a transfirmer.
Artful expression of a solid chair made from sawed out chunks of wood and painted grey and red, with the boards at the supports painted black.
This is a heavy set throne like chair decorated in black, red and gray. It appears to be set up on a small pedestal.
