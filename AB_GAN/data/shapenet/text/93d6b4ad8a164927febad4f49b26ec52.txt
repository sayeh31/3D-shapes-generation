A weird-looking white table with two wooden legs that resembles a square.
It's a small bedside table with square shaped white top. On two parallel sides of the top there are two wooden, brown bars that are connected to two parallel bars of the same material going town from the bottom of the table to its bases - once again, parallel horizontal lines, connected to the vertical bars by two much shorter diagonal ones.
