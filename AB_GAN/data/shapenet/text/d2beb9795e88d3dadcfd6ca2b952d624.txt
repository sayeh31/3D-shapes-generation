An interesting short and round, black coffee table. It is supported by several legs that are all at an angle that balance each other out.
A round top table grey in colour
A round dining table.
This is a round table.  The legs are very different, with several legs that appear to cross each other, and it appears that maybe they allow the table to swivel.
it almost looks as though it is a gyroscope with a flat surface on top the picture doesn't reflect completely what a table looks like, the legs are at strange angles
