A metallic table with a shallow table top and 4 legs support
This looks to me like a metallic, somewhat frightening, Foosball table with more than needed handles for the bars for the game on each side of it. It is rectangular in shape, with an empty space - a hole - throughout the top of it, and small thick cylindrical horizontal handles, or bars, through the lengths of each of the top's sides. Down the height of the table, again, on each side, there's a plain area and a set of long horizontal lines, and there are four cylindrical legs on each edge of the table.
