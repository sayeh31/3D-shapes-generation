This is a large square coffee table with textured top and legs.  I has four post legs that narrow slightly at the bottom.
A peculiarly looking wooden table which is four legged and has lined carving all over the surface.
green ridges all over table with a white cup and sauce on it
Table is brown, short, squatted with a black cup and saucer in one corner. The table looks to be cross hatched and carries through to the legs as well.
It is a brownish,square shaped,plastic and rough top with slated edges
