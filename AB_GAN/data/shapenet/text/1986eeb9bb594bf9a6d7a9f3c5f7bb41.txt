chair with cushion , orange color
Light wood chair with four legs and a whole in the back.  The seat and back are covered in a red fabric.
I don't know how else to describe this same chair I keep seeing.  Please at least give me a different angle or something.  This is a simple, kitchen table size chair with hard surfaces, no padding, 4 legs, and a slightly curved inward back, but also a very straight vertical back.  It looks very uncomfortable.
