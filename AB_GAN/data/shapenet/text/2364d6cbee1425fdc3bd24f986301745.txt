We tested objects with similar colors (red, yellow, green, and blue) made of different materials, and objects made of the same material that differed only in color. We asked observers to adjust the color of a uniform disk presented on a computer screen until its color appearance represented a good match to the color appearance of the object. The observers' matches were compared to photometric measurements made at various points across the part of the surface of the objects that was visible to the observers.
