A ASH COLOR RECTANGULAR SHAPED WOODEN MADE FOUR STAND CHAIR
This is a white, wooden, "kitchen" type of chair, with four turn-style legs, connected by four smaller posts, creating a square about three inches above the leg bases. Graduated slats, enclosed in an uneven horseshoe-shaped frame of wood, are attached to a seat, comprised of an uneven square, with the shorter end being the slat-end.
This is a classic wooden chair for a dinning room table. There are spools along the back of the chair and there are no arm rests.
