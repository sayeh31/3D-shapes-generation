A gray office table that is supported by a cental base. The top is flat on one side and rounded on the other.
This table is gray, has a unique half-circle mized with a square shape which could allow you to place it against the wall and have the circular portion jut out from the wall. It looks modern but not very functional and I personally find that it is not a good use of space.
This is a desk chair. It swivels but it has no back rest.
A plastic light grey table with an x-shaped base connecting to a pole and a half-rectangle-half-circle surface.
A black rounded table with one straight end. There are 4 feet at the base of the table.
