Four pointer shaped bottom brown coloured glass table
this is a designer table with glass top, used in livings rooms
Looks to be a coffee table, it has a nice curved design to it. It is made out of a light wood with a glass top.
This is a glass-topped coffee table with a sheet of curved glass and an artistic wooden structure underneath that is the same shape as the glass above it.  The glass is held up by four cones at each corner of the warped rectangular wood and the legs of the table beneath that are cones that are inverted the other way.
