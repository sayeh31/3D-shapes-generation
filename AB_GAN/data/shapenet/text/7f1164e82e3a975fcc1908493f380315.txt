There is a wooden chair that has a curved back seat that slims down into a hourglass shape and then widens again to form the circular seat. The arms and legs are made of one long pipe that starts at the ground, connects to the seat, forms an arch for the arm rest, connects to the seat again and goes back to the ground.
