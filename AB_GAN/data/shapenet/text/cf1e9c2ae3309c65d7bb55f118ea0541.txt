a simple white wooden solid chair is very good for my house
gray high back chair with plane metal base.
It's a gray chair with 4 legs and a backrest.
A four-legged stool like chair made of aluminium.
This is a very tall chair, square-like in appearance.  The four legs are very square.  The front legs are thicker than the back legs.  The back of the chair seems separated from the chair itself.
