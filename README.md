# AB-GAN: Adabeleif Generative Adversarial Networks for Generating 3D Shapes from Natural Language Texts 
##introducton


in this repo you can find a code for train and evaluate AB-GAN.
AB-GAN is a modified version of DM-GAN represented in[] by substituting the Adam optimizer with the AdaBeleif optimizer which is traiend using ShapeNet datset for generating 3D chairs and tabels based on natural language discription.

you can find pre-process data here:

and the following fig shows some 3D shapes which are generate using state-of- art gan models compare to our AB-GAN model.
